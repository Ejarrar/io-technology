## 1. Remove Unused Imports with Ease

Especially when refactoring, a file can end up with a lot of unused imports. VSCode provides a handy shortcut to remove unused imports swiftly. Simply press `CMD + Option + O` (or `Shift + Alt + O` on Windows). This will remove any unnecessary imports, decluttering your codebase. Alternative: I've also seen developers put this in an auto-fixable ESLint rule instead.

## 2. Rename Variables Effortlessly

Renaming variables can be a tedious and error-prone task, especially when you have multiple usages. In VSCode, you can simplify this process by utilizing the `F2` key. Place your cursor on the variable you want to rename and press `F2`. VSCode will automatically update all instances of the variable throughout your code, ensuring consistency and saving you valuable time.

## 3. Create Custom Shortcuts for Frequent Actions

Do you find yourself repeatedly performing a specific action in VSCode? You can create your own custom shortcuts to streamline your workflow. For instance, if you frequently use a particular command or extension, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it. To do this, go to the VSCode settings (`Code` > `Preferences` > `Keyboard Shortcuts`) and search for the desired action. Once found, click on the pencil icon and set your preferred shortcut. This way, you can quickly trigger the action without the need for manual navigation.

## 4. Custom shortcut: Swiftly Fix ESLint Issues

Integrating ESLint into your development workflow helps maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards. I'm assuming you already use ESLint, and hopefully, you are combining it with prettier too. You probably have it set up so that ESLint's autofix runs on save, but I like to quickly execute this manually as well.

Open the keyboard shortcuts settings as mentioned earlier and open the keybindings.json JSON file by clicking on the file icon in the top right corner. Copy the below code and assign a key combination of your choice (e.g., `Ctrl + ,`, that's what I use) to instantly trigger the ESLint auto-fix feature. Especially helpful if you have ESLint setup in a way that it does a lot of things automatically, like fixing the import order.

```json
[
  {
    "key": "cmd+.",
    "command": "eslint.executeAutofix"
  }
]
```

## 5. Personal favourite: Automate missing imports

Adding imports manually can be repetitive and time-consuming, even with the auto-import functionality (quick-fix -> add all missing imports.). To automate this process, you can create a shortcut for the "Quick Fix: add all missing
imports" command. For instance, you can set it to `CMD + '`. This way, whenever you
encounter an unresolved import, you can simply use the shortcut to automatically
add the necessary imports, saving you the hassle of searching, typing, and importing
manually. Add the following to the keybindings.json file, the same as in the previous
tip.

```json
[
  {
    "key": "cmd+'",
    "command": "editor.action.sourceAction",
    "args": {
      "kind": "source.addMissingImports",
      "apply": "first"
    }
  }
]
```

I sincerely hope these five tips will help you out, and will also encourage you to explore what else you can do in VSCode to optimize your workflow.
